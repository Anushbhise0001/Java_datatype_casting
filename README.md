Data type casting in Java is used to convert one data type into another data type so that memory consumption can be controlled.
Type casting of two types is used in Java type casting.

Widening casting:- In widening casting, a small size data type is converted into a big size data type.
                   There is no risk of data loss in this.

Narrowing casing:- In Narrowing casting we convert a big size data type into a small size data type and in this process there are chances of data loss.
